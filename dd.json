Overall, these hauntings do not detract from the old building, instead adding to its unique and historical charm."

    "longitude": -87.63179397596105,
    "story": "Although most ghost websites will refer to this place as Old Bryce Mental Hospital, this is not an accurate designation.\nThere is a Bryce Mental Hospital in Alabama, but it has been located in Tuscaloosa since its inception in 1861 and the Jemison Center, as this place is accurately called, was not founded as a health care facility until the 1920’s.\nTherefore, it could hardly be considered the “Old Bryce Mental Hospital”.\nThis is one of those places and cases where it is hard to separate fact from fiction. Most accounts written about Jemison tell of this place being a segregated facility where freed blacks who had trouble adjusting to life after slavery were sent, and who were virtually forced back into slavery due to the need for the asylum to be self-funded. The patients were therefore required to toil in the fields and produce crops that would be profitable, making the lives of these former slaves little different than their days on the plantations. However, anyone who can do simple math can see the slight problem with this. As Jemison was not opened up until approximately 60 years after the abolition of slavery, it does not seem likely that “recently freed blacks” who had trouble with adjustment would have been there. And it does not seem likely that former slaves between the ages of 70-80 would have been sent back into the fields to toil at Jemison if they had been transferred there in the 1920’s. So already, we have a case of fact interfering with a good story and more likely the histories of the actual Bryce Hospital (which no doubt did take in some freedmen) and Jemison center getting entangled. In any event, this place was an institutionalized setting and the people who lived here no doubt did experience all the numerous horrors that were associated with being a mentally ill patient in the early 20th century. The reports of haunting include a variety of events: people hearing voices, footsteps, the sounds of slamming doors, as well as more violent encounters with hair being pulled and the sensation of being hit or kicked. This place is a falling down ruin and if you are caught trespassing, you will be prosecuted so we advise you to err on the side of caution if you are considering visiting."

People who previously slept and lived in the mansion reported seeing her ghost watching over them as they rested, while other reported hearing and seeing her walking around the house and its grounds.

These canyons were cut by streams with headwaters in the Chuska mountains just to the east of the monument. None of the land is federally owned. Canyon de Chelly long served as a home for Navajo people before it was invaded by forces led by future New Mexico governor Lt. Antonio Narbona in 1805. In 1863 Col. Kit Carson sent troops to either end of the canyon to defeat the Navajo population within. The resulting devastation led to the surrender of the Navajos and their removal to Bosque Redondo, New Mexico.

In 1984 a man named Robert Moormann, who was mentally handicapped, got out of the Correctional Facility on furlough, and upon being released into his abusive mother’s care, the man (who was really nothing more than a man-child,) checked into the motel with his mother, where he tied her up and proceeded to beat and stab her to death.

People claimed they could hear a woman crying in the motel at night, even when there was no one there.

    "story": "One of the most well-known haunted hotels in America, the Crescent hotel has a history that just requires there to be ghosts and haunts associated with it.\nAnd the Crescent has plenty.\nThe site of a former hospital run by a con artist who had previously been convicted of practicing medicine without a license, the fraudulent sawbones promised a cure for cancer.\nPatients walked in on their own two feet and were carried out feet first. Deaths were so numerous that the basement housed its own morgue, which is a main tourist attraction now, sharing space with the hotel’s day spa. Ghost sightings and stories are numerous and not limited to the Crescent’s stint as a health facility, there are also ghosts who date from its construction and its time as a girls’ school. Room 218 is said to be one of the most haunted rooms and it is claimed that this is where a former construction worker died when he fell, striking his head on a stone lintel. In addition room 419 is said to be haunted by a female ghost they call Theodora and rooms 202 and 424 are said to be haunted as well. Staff also claim that apparitions routinely walk the halls, especially nurses seen pushing people in wheelchairs. The hotel offers a nightly ghost tour that will take you through the hotel, pointing out all the rooms and stories associated with the building and ending up in the former morgue turned maintenance room. We have stayed twice in the Crescent hotel, in rooms 218 and 202. Neither time did anything of a spooktacular nature occur. Well one thing did occur: the jacuzzi tub turned on all by itself in the middle of the night. At first, we thought this was interesting, however on inspecting the bathroom (including the electrical outlet that had been sawed in half in order to fit it into the space right next to the tub) we determined that the jacuzzi turning on was more to do with the very scary electrical wiring than any scary supernatural occurrence. The hotel is old and shabby and in dire need of repairs, with holes in the carpet and peeling paint and the elevator at the time of this writing (Spring 2013) was out of service as it is being “renovated” for over a year and a half now. Apparently none of the money they are making on their ghost tours, fairly high room fees and merchandising is being put back into the hotel. If you are considering staying here, pack lightly and be prepared to climb stairs."

It’s mad, and it’s wonderful. Several of the rooms can only be accessed from a rooftop courtyard that is filled with interesting water features, numerous planters overflowing with bougainvillea and other assorted flowers and an immense herb garden. Although we did not get a haunted room when we were there (the one that was available, the famed “Aunt Alice room” is priced at over $600 a night and therefore just slightly beyond our budget) we do not feel at all disappointed by having visited though we did not experience anything remotely “ghostly”. Most of the reports of hauntings are of the benign sort. People claim to see figures walking down hallways and when they get closer, the apparitions vanish. People who have stayed in Aunt Alice’s room feel cold spots, report being touched and claim they have seen her apparition. One spot that does provide some trouble is in the Bridal Suite where some people report being pushed as they descend the spiral staircase located in the room. The hotel is also situated on a network of catacombs that are unfortunately closed to the public due to safety reasons. Whether you are interested in haunted hotels or not, the Mission Inn is worth checking out."

    "story": "Built in 1906 in the middle of Mira Flores Park by builder Davis Donald for Mr. and Mrs.\nKirke Field.\nBoth had moved West due to suffering from ‘Consumption’ (Tuberculosis).\nThey met at a sanitarium in Colorado and were friends of Doc Holiday. Mrs. Field died shortly after the mansion was finished, and Mr. Field sold it soon after to the Moore family (Moore Middle School/ owners of Redlands Daily Facts Newspaper) which owned it for nearly 7 decades. One prominent guest of the house was California governor in the 1920s, Friend Richardson, and an apparition matching his description was seen by two people in 2005. The specter was crawling on hands and knees, dressed in night clothes, and stopped, turned and smiled, and then continued on in the direction of the room where the governor had stayed many decades earlier. Several people are recorded as having died in the house, which has approximately 25 rooms. Fieldmoore was once owned by the president of General Mills, and has had butlers, cooks, gardeners, governesses, and maids working on staff. Ghosts that have been sighted include one dubbed ‘the tall man’, which once invited a construction worker to come down the outdoor stairs that lead to the cellar. The worker was discovered sitting at the top of the staircase, crying, shaking his head and repeating ‘I don’t want to go down there!’. The ‘tall man’s’ figure has been seen at night in the main dining room with his arms folded across his chest, but he is only seen in the reflection of the leaded glass windows of the adjoining living room. He does not fit the description of either Mr. Field, nor Mr. Moore, so his identity is a mystery. a young man has been seen sitting in the dark on the inside stairs of the cellar. Another spirit there will climb the grand staircase, each step clearly heard, and then knock gently on the door of the master suite at the top of the stairs. Sometimes the door handle will also be turned! The burglar alarm for the mansion would go off regularly when the owners were not at home and the police would come out only to find nothing. One time the alarm went off when the owner was at home and the police arrived. The owner let the police in to search the mansion but no one was found. The policeman drew his gun and went to search the house, but after being informed of the reputation of the house being haunted, the brave officer’s hand and the drawn pistol were shaking! He could handle a burglar, no problem, but a ghost was another thing altogether!                                                                                                                                                                                        Doors will open and slam even when there is no wind, and the electric gates have often opened and closed by themselves. Once, a former owner of the house, had his name called loudly from a lower floor in the house. The owner heard a younger woman’s voice call his name out loud. The man figured someone had come inside the house and was looking for him so he responded ‘Yes? I’m upstairs!” , but when searching found no one in the house. What was spooky about this event was that this owner’s name was ‘Kirk’, which is the same name as the original owner (Kirke Filed). Another worker complained about being followed by an apparition that was dressed in a maid’s uniform. This spirit would not cross the threshold of the master suite. Today the house is the executive mansion for the president of the University of Redlands."

    "latitude": 40.383333,
    "longitude": -105.518333,
    "story": "Anyone who is vaguely interested in haunted hotels will have heard of the Stanley Hotel.\nThe Stanley claims it is the inspiration for the haunted horror of  Stephen King’s The Shining and with a long oral history of “ghostly adventures” occurring there, the Stanley is well aware of the money to be made off of its haunted reputation and has made it into quite an industry.\nThey readily admit to charging almost $150 more for their “haunted” rooms than they do for any other room at the same time of the season.\nThey have running ghost tours and a psychic that does readings. If you decide to splash out for a ghost room, which we did, you had better be prepared for a sleepless night, not necessarily because of any ghostly activity but because there will be constant groups of people standing outside your door saying “Are you there?  Is anyone there? Make this red light flash, if you are there. If you have something you wish to communicate, speak into this machine and we will hear you.”  So basically you will be paying a premium to be annoyed ALL. NIGHT. LONG. You should also not waste time getting a psychic reading, we did and she was so off on absolutely everything that it was clear she was either having the worst night in history, or our flat-faced stoicism completely flummoxed her attempts at cold reading. We do recommend the ghost tour for those interested because it provides an interesting look into the Stanley history, haunted and regular, and our guide “Scary Mary” actually did a better job of providing an “intuitive reading” on one of us than the resident psychic. Which is not to say she sat down with us, she just came up to us at the end and said her spirit children wanted her to pass along a message to us, and it was fairly spot on and accurate. So that was interesting, although I must provide the caveat that we were not as vigilant in flummoxing cold reading on the tour as we were with the psychic. However, “Scary Mary” is actually a very sweet and informative guide and we very much recommend her. Now having given a run-down of the business of ghosts at the Stanley, let’s delve into the fun of the stories. The Stanley hotel was built in 1909 by Freelan and Flora Stanley of Stanley Steamer fortune. They had initialy come to Colorado in an attempt to alleviate the symptoms of Freelan’s tuberculosis but enjoyed it so much they purchased property and built a home. Shortly thereafter, they built the Stanley as a summer resort for the guests they wished to entertain during their extended vacations in Colorado. People today believe that Flora may still be “living” at the Stanley as one of her favorite pastimes was playing the piano, and the piano is often heard being played late at night when there is no one around. In addition many people have heard sounds of revelry occurring in the empty ballroom. Room 217 and 401 get singled out for special attention as people report numerous different disturbances occurring in these two rooms. For instance, 401 is claimed to have a haunted closet where a man is seen standing and there are reports of banging noises coming from the closet. This is absolutely true, banging noises do come from the closet because the closet shares a wall with the old, shuddering elevator. Room 217 is said to be haunted by a more interesting ghost who is believed to be the long-term housekeeper of the Stanley. Reportedly, if she likes you, she will help you unpack your luggage. Room 217 is also the room Stephen King stayed in that allegedly inspired The Shining (it should be pointed out however, that another hotel also claims to be the inspiration and King has stated that the Stanley is not the inspiration)."

    "story": "Gold Camp Road, as children we are told to stay away.\nAs teenagers we become curious and try to investigate.\nAs adults, we know to be wary.\nI have lived in Colorado Springs my whole life and I have always known of the secret behind Gold Camp Road. Legend has it that the third tunnel collapsed as a school bus crashed into it. Apparently the bus driver either committed suicide or suffered from a heart attack. All the children died. The third tunnel is now fenced off, however one can still walk up to the dark cave. These are not the only deaths that took place in these tunnels. Not to mention, many people died building these tunnels in the 1800s. Annually, bodies wash up around the area which would cause many angered spirits. Also, let’s not forget that this area is surrounded by satan worshipers. In the 1970s and 1980s and probably still today, men are seen chanting in black robes carrying torches as they walk up past the haunted tunnels. My father has personally witnessed this as a teenager twice, while him and a friend of his snuck up there to have a few beers on the weekends. The rituals that do take place in the area would awaken spirits and demons. In the third tunnel, the laughs and voices of children are heard, along with feeling a tugging on clothing. Tiny hand prints are also found on cars parked outside the tunnel. The second tunnel is more violently active however. People report scratches, being hit, groped, voices, and possession. The figure of a man is commonly seen as well at the end of the tunnel. Many say that when they inspect the car afterward, there are handprints and finger marks all over. Even on clean cars a hand print will occasionally appear. This may seem like a scary story, however it is truth. I have personally experienced sightings in the second tunnel, which is the most active, considering many are too afraid to travel outside of a car to venture into the third tunnel. On an average night of driving around with friends, we made the decision to check out the stories of Gold Camp for ourselves. We heard that if we were to drive into the second tunnel and turn off our lights the car would either move, the lights would come on, or something weird would happen. There were four of us that night, Savannah, Doug, Andy, and myself. We drove into the second tunnel, turned off the car, and put up the e-brake. We began to joke around a little, saying how it was just a scary story to keep children away, then we saw a figure pacing at the end of the tunnel, behind the car. We watched as the figure moved closer and closer, faster and faster. Eventually it reached the back of our car, so close that we could almost make out the face of a man. His head tilted as he looked at us and set his hands on the back of the car. Suddenly he was gone. We spoke of what we just saw as the figure reappeared at the end of the tunnel pacing again. We kept all eight of our eyes on this figure. Out of nowhere, the figure bolted towards our car. Doug quickly turned the car on and shoved it into drive. We raced as fast as possible out of the tunnel, so fast I thought we would fly off the side of the mountain. Once we reached a safe distance away from this thing we just saw, we caught our breath. And made sure that we all really just saw that, and of course we all did. Unfortunately, we had to drive back through the creepy dark tunnel to get back to the main road. I kept my eyes shut, not wanting to see this figure of a man again. After reaching safety, we drove to a close by, brightly lit gas station to inspect any damage to the car. There on the dusty trunk lay the imprints of a mans hands. I will never forget this night, I am just glad nothing worse happened. However, I do wish I had caught this all on camera to show everyone what I personally experienced. Submitted by Rockelle M."

Several unexplained occurrences are said to have taken place at the house (which is now owned by the local historical society). At one time, while an independent film was being filmed there on location, an actress went to an upstairs bedroom (once used by Priscilla Hamill) to practice some operatic singing. She swore later that she saw a whooshing Victorian-era dress flit past the doorway while she was up there, and was astonished to learn later that she was the only person upstairs. Subsequent paranormal investigations claimed to have captured ghostly responses to questions via flashlights and other ghost-hunting paraphernalia. Tours are available. Fun fact – these Hamills are related to Mark Hamill, who played Luke Skywalker in Star Wars."

    "story": "This is one of the older ghost stories of the area, and one that may well be forgotten by all but the oldest local residents.\nAn article in the Wilmington Sunday Star from October 4, 1953 tells the story, which was almost forgotten even then.\nThe legend went that there was a local slave who enjoyed playing the fiddle back in the mid-1800s.\nPeople knew about his virtuoso fiddle skills far and wide. But after he incurred a severe beating, he was never quite the same. He ran off and lived the rest of his life as a recluse in the woods around St Georges. Many nights he’d be seen playing mournful tunes on his fiddle on the bridge that spanned Scott’s Run. Eventually, one night, he drowned there. Many years later locals stumbled onto the fact that if you threw a dime over the bridge at Scott’s Run, the ghostly sound of fiddle music would start emanating from the area. Everyone assumed it was the ghost of the virtuoso who died there. The original bridge is long-gone (it was gone even by the time of the 1953 article), but the road eventually became US 13 (DuPont Parkway), and there is still a small bridge there that crosses Scott’s Run. No word on whether or not the dime trick still works today."

The servant was said to have deliberately cursed the family by giving him the doll. Otto’s parents soon noticed that the boy seemed to be conversing with the doll, and that the doll seemed to talk back. The doll also was caught giggling madly while running from room to room, and the neighbors said the doll moved from window to window while the family was out. Robert was also blamed for knocking over furniture in the night. In short, the doll seemed to be alive. Fast forward to 1974 when Otto passed away and the doll was left in the attic. The new family who bought the house had a 10-year-old girl who would often scream at night and say Robert tried to attack her. It is said that 30 years later she still maintained that the doll was alive. This doll was the inspiration for the Chucky film franchise. Beware! Legend has it that those who want to take a photograph of Robert where he is on display must ask nicely. If he agrees to let you photograph him, he will tip his head to one side.

    "longitude": -82.82738999999998,
    "story": "I was a former employee of Crabby Bill’s Seafood on Clearwater Beach in the Clearwater Municipal Marina.\nI wasn’t a server, host, nor did I work as a cook or a dishwasher.\nI worked from June/July of 2009 up until August of 2011 on the third shift.\nI was the only cleaning guy at the building, aside from the only maintenance guy who would build shelves, paint floors, grout tiles, etc. The maintenance guy who worked years before I did, Kenny, is actually a really good friend of mine back then. He was the one who had me hired on because they needed someone from 10:00 p.m. until the job is finished. Mind you, the building is a two-story building but this isn’t what scared people away for a long period of time. The reason why this company has had an issue with long-time third shift cleaners is because of all the well-accounted paranormal activity that had been reported to management and even the actual business owner himself. None of it had ever been taken seriously though. Before my first night working as a cleaner, my friend Kenny was telling me on my way to work that the place had a lot of weird stuff that would happen EVERY. SINGLE. NIGHT. He had told me that one time as he was painting the bathroom walls in the second floor restroom, he stepped out of the men’s room to look for a different can of paint but for the life of him, he couldn’t find it at all. He went down to the first floor, checked around in the cabinet where his tools and supplies are it. Nothing. He went back upstairs and checked into the men’s room to see if he had brought it back in. Nothing. Here’s where it had gotten weird. As he walked out of the men’s room, propped up against the bathroom door was the same can of paint that he had been searching for that hadn’t been there ten seconds before he had walked back into the men’s room. He obviously couldn’t have closed the restroom door, not before laying a can of paint completely flat against it. He’s had lights flick on and off. He’s been on the first floor and hear loud and notable footsteps on the second floor. He’s heard whispers and the eyes on the back of his head. These are his experiences, mind you. Now let’s hear about mine. My first night there, I was cleaning the second floor men’s room. As I was scrubbing the bathroom sinks, I hear the toilet in the women’s room flush. At this point, the only two people in this building would have been myself and Kenny. As it turns out, I needed to ask him a question about my new job. As I walked into the women’s room, I called out his name to absolutely no response. I then checked every single stall in the women’s room. There was no one there at all. As I checked the last stall, I noticed that the water in the toilet had been filling itself back up. Meaning, it was ACTUALLY flushed and not just randomly running. I immediately stepped out of the women’s room to the point where I could hear him behind the restaurant on the ground level, using a table saw to cut wood for shelves. Mind you now, where he was at and where I had heard the toilet flushed, it would have taken him at least a whole minute to get from that second floor bathroom all the way to the first floor, through the entire restaurant, and then out in the back with safety gear on as he was cutting wood. I went downstairs and I asked him about him being upstairs in the second floor women’s room. He gave me a confused look and shook his head. Then he gave me that look, like the things he had told me about his experiences here were now happening to me. I told him that there had been no one else in the building except me. If there had been someone else upstairs, I would have bumped into them on a few occasions. Alas, it was just me. That was my first night on my job! My FIRST night! The rest of the 21-months of my time there, things would happen all the time. There would be plates on the first floor kitchen that would just randomly rattle shortly after I would walk by the table. I’d try to recreate the rattling by walking, stomping, and running by that table. It never would never happen. I wasn’t able to debunk that. The table itself was pretty heavy so I know that it wasn’t me making the plates rattle. I’ve had chairs randomly fall off of tables that were placed there so that I could vacuum and mop under those tables. I’ve had things randomly slam into the walls hard enough to shake the entire building. I’ve heard noises on the stairs, as if someone were walking up or down. This was a nightly thing and this had never bothered me. That was, until out of curiosity I brought from my home a digital voice recorder. It was a slow night and I had a few friends down from another county. During the time they had visited, I placed the voice recorder on the second floor and then left the building to have a cigarette to chit-chat with my friends as the floor was also drying up top. About 35 to 40 minutes later, I went back into the building after they had left and headed straight back upstairs. After stopping the recording, I plugged in my headphones and played it as I went through my night. Roughly around 40 minutes into the actual recorder… Something had been picked up. Mind you, I was outside and my buddy and his fiancee were also outside. The noises of us talking hadn’t been picked up by my recorder. We were the only three people in the entire parking lot, yet you could hear a voice on my recorder sounding like a woman screaming, followed by crying. Exactly a minute later, you could hear what sounded like a male voice laughing. It’s on my Facebook page so feel free to send me a message and I’ll link you to my uploads. The EVP caught me completely off-guard but that wasn’t the scariest part. THE scariest part that had happened to me was roughly around 3:00 in the morning. I was entirely alone and I had just finished mopping the first floor. Since it’s the main entrance of the restaurant, I wanted that spot to look the absolute best and brightest. Once I had finished mopping, I went out to smoke a cigarette while I waited for the floor to dry. I played on my iTouch, listened to music, made a phone call, smoked another cigarette, and then went back inside. That’s when the worst happened. There is a lift inside this restaurant in the event that a customer wants to eat on the second floor but is in a wheelchair. Obviously they couldn’t force the patron in a chair to dine outside, so that’s where the lift comes into handy. It isn’t an elevator, mind you. The host/hostess will push you into the lift, go in the lift with you, and press to HOLD the up-button until you reach the second floor. The door will unlock and you can then leave the lift. The host/hostess will then press and HOLD the down-button to take it to the first floor. Once the lift hits bottom, the door unlocks again to which they return to his or her position at the hostess stand. My experience: as I walked back inside of the front door to check on the drying of the floor, I heard the lift coming down from the second floor all the way to the first. Like I said, you have to hold the button down. If you let go of the button between floors, it stops. Something had held the button until it had reached the first floor because you could definitely hear the lift door click loudly as it unlocked. I grabbed the closest item I could find as a weapon (in the event that someone had broken in and were using the lift to get heavy stuff downstairs) and moved to the lift door. I ripped the door open and found that it was entirely empty. As I poked my head into the lift room, I could hear something bump into the door on the second floor. I immediately assumed that Kenny might have been messing with me. So I ran back to the hostess stand and called him from the phone. He told me that he’s sitting on his couch, drinking a beer, and catching up on his DVR. As I was on the phone with him, I could hear footsteps directly above me on the second floor. At this point, the hair on the back of my neck went up. The noises were so loud, even Kenny on the phone could hear that. He told me to call the security guard. I hung up and called security. Security shows up and we walked through the second floor of the building. Mind you, the lights were off because I was done upstairs but I had to turn the lights back on. We went through the kitchen, behind the bar, and through the restrooms; nothing. We were the only two (living) folks in the building. He presumed that I was on drugs or that I was just messing with him because I was bored. As he was walking down the stairs, poking fun at me, the lights to the second floor cut off on it’s own. His face went white as a ghost. We both ran down the steps. The was the worst experience that I had ever had. Even the security guard believed me when I had told him what had happened. It obviously wasn’t me messing with anyone. He knew that I had told the truth. After that night, my usual encounters went back to normal: rattling plates, footsteps on stairs, chairs falling. That wasn’t bad at all. Submitted by K.R."

She had a feeling something bad would happen, and sure enough, a storm capsized his boat and he drowned. Mabel stayed in the hotel until her death shortly thereafter, and apparently, even then she didn’t leave. Her ghost has been seen by many, often with suitcase in hand and sometimes asking guests “When are we leaving?” She also moves the crystal wine decanter top and other items, and ghost hunters have determined that she has company: the spirits of a young boy and a man with a handlebar mustache also have been detected."

    "story": "The Belleview Biltmore Resort and Spa is a historic resort hotel located at 25 Belleview Boulevard in the town of Belleair, Florida, USA.\nThe hotel is closed, but a renovation plan has been announced.\nThe hotel situated along the eastern shores of Old Clearwater Bay, with views of the bay and the barrier islands which border the Gulf of Mexico.\nThe hotel was built in 1897 by railroad tycoon Henry B. Plant and was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places on December 26, 1979. However, this provides no protection from demolition. Recently, the owner planned to demolish the hotel in 2012 to be replaced with condos, though plans to restore the hotel have come through as of late. The 820,000 square feet (76,000 m2) hotel structure is the last remaining grand historic hotel of its period in Florida that exists as a resort, and the only remaining Henry Plant hotel still in operation. The building is noted for its architectural features, with its unique green sloped roof and white wood sided exterior, and extensive hand crafted woodwork and Tiffany glass inside. It is said to be the largest occupied wood frame structure in the world, and is constructed of native Florida pine wood. The hotel property at large consists of over 160 acres (65 ha), including swimming pools, a beach club, restaurant, and a golf course. The hotel itself is located on 20.203 acres (8.176 ha) and has ballroom facilities and is a popular location for weddings and other gatherings. The Belleview Biltmore has hosted many famous people, dignitaries and world leaders through the years, including U.S. Presidents Barack Obama, George H. W. Bush, Jimmy Carter, and Gerald Ford, former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and the Duke of Windsor, and celebrities such as Joe DiMaggio, Babe Ruth, Thomas Edison, and Henry Ford. The hotel is thought by some to be the site of ghost sightings and other paranormal events. The Hotel was featured in a segment on the Weird Travels series on the Travel Channel television network in the U.S., which was filmed in March 2004 by Authentic Entertainment."

Teams in johnboats swore they heard whimpering and screaming around the swampy crash site, but when they searched there was no one to be found. One searcher had the uncomfortable experience of seeing a pale, eyeless body floating just beneath the water – he turned to tell his colleagues about the find, and when he turned back to the same spot, it was gone.

    "story": "William Cooley was an early settler in East Florida.\nHe moved to the New River area (later to become Fort Lauderdale) in 1826 and started an arrowroot plantation.\nEventually he became involved in local administration, and in 1835/6 he was involved in adjudicating a case in which white settlers were accused of killing a Creek Indian chief named Alibama.\nThe settlers were jailed but later released, citing insufficient evidence. The Creeks were outraged, and laid much of the blame for the verdict on Cooley’s shoulders. On January 4th, 1836, a part of 15-20 Indians raided Cooley’s home while he was away on an expedition, killing his wife and children. The incident has since been known as the “New River Massacre” or “Cooley’s Massacre.”  It effectively ended the New River settlement – it would be more than a half century before whites would resettle in the area again in significant numbers. Cooley himself moved to Tampa, where he died in 1863. Nothing remains of the original plantation, but a small park called “Cooley’s Landing” has been erected on the spot where it once stood, on the north side of the river.  (Some sources place Cooley’s plantation on the south side, which is called “Cooley’s Landing South” today, but local historians believe it was indeed on the north side.)  It is said that each year, around January, the screams of dying children are heard here."

    "story": "The house is allegedly haunted by a variety of ghosts, most of them dating back to the late 1800’s and the stories revolve around two suicides that took place there, though it is claimed that one of the suicides may have been a murder.\nThe house was owned by Francis Sorrel, who had made one of the slave women his mistress.\nWhen his wife Matilda happened to catch them in the act, she was so distraught that she hurled herself off the balcony of her room and died in the courtyard below.\nA short time after Matilda’s suicide, the slave, whose name was Molly, was found hanged in her room in the carriage house. It is claimed that letters and journals that have been uncovered indicate Molly did not commit suicide, but was killed by a member of the Sorrel family in an attempt to silence her and keep the affair under wraps. However, these papers are not on display and this cannot be confirmed. Whether it is factual or just an invention to add to the lore is unknown at this time. Neither the papers, nor the many ghostly pictures that the tour guide alleges exist are on display. People claim to see shadowy figures in the windows, and voices can be heard when there is no one inside the house. However, it should be noted that people passing by from the street can easily be heard from inside the house and the carriage house. There is a “Lady in White” apparition that is said to appear in one of the parlors, as well as a gaggle of grand dame ghosts who also occupy the ladies’ parlor and disapprove of the tours. The Sorrel Weed House has been featured on both a Halloween episode of “Ghost Hunters” and the HGTV show “If Walls Could Talk.”  The historic state landmark is open for tours, and has day tours that focus strictly on the history of the home, while the night tours focus on the ghost tales. The tour we took was better than average ghost tour fare, low on the melodrama and spectacle and an interesting blend of fact and lore. Nothing remotely spooky happened during our tour to any of our group. However, later on, in listening to some EVP recordings we made, there were some interesting sounds captured in Molly’s room and one specific answer to questions asked. However, as we cannot exclude the possibility that we were picking up noise or voices from the other members of our group, who were on the other side of the door and could occasionally be heard, we have to discount them."

But it is said that some of the cremated bodies were not actually dead, and the tormented souls who burned alive still remain in the area."

    "story": "This building was built in 1918, and shut down in 1999, due to chemical leaks from the basement pipes.\nSince it was shut down, there have been many sightings of ghosts and what some believe may be demons, or the angry spirits of the patients who just happened to die .in the hospital.\nThe hospital went through many changes, and reached many stages.\nIt went from a hospital, to an asylum, to an old folks home, and then right back to a hospital. After it was shut down, many people broke in to see what kind of strange things they could find in this historic building. In the east wing, the “pink room” was found. Bright pink walls, smeared with blood that seemed to be placed there by the angry spirit of the psychopath that once resided there. The basement and morgue were places not many had the courage to explore. The majority of those who went into the basement and/or morgue, never entered the building again. The citizens living near and around the building, told of an apparation they saw running through the hospitals yard. In spring on 2016, the building caught on fire, and half of it was torn down. All that is left now of the building is one wing, containing the chapel, kitchen, boiler room, and a few patients rooms. On the chapel floor, you can find strange scratches and blood stains, along with items used for satanic rituals. The building left with a strange history, and the spirits who left it becomes more angry and restless every day, as the horror of what happened to their home hits them. Demolished, May 2016."

Both the dog and Heinl’s apparitions have been seen, along with the phantom smell of John’s pipe. Another cemetery legend is about Martin Sheets, a businessman in the early 1900s who had a deep fear of being buried alive. He had a custom-designed casket with latches on the inside to thwart such a terror from happening to him, and he planned to be buried in a mausoleum instead of underground. Furthermore, the mausoleum was rigged with a telephone. When he passed away and was entombed in his mausoleum, nothing eventful happened, but Sheets had paid for the phone to remain in service for years.

    "story": "2220 N.\nArmstrong Kokomo Indiana is now an empty lot.\nThere is no longer a home on the property.\nIt was burned by a serial arsonist. He caused more than  22 structural fires in Kokomo. My childhood home was his last. The arsonist lived  houses away from my house. At that time, July 2001, the arsonist was caught  and told police that it brought him relief to cause the fire. I often wondered if he could feel the evil that lived there…maybe emanating from the structure which used to be my home. We first moved to the house in 1971 after shortly having moved to Kokomo Indiana from Chattanooga Tennessee. My father was a trained youth pastor and had returned from Seminary Bible College with his collection of Biblical Commentaries and educational books. My father was a prayer warrior and persistent reader of the Bible. These mannerisms were practiced continually. Retrospectively, I see now why the demonic entities residing there attacked him and my family. As a little girl I noticed, almost immediately, the darkness that resided in that house. I heard scratching noises on the ceiling and walls in the afternoon s and evenings. In the early 1970’s my parents witnessed bouncing blue lights go from wall to wall in the living room. My father didn’t know how to explain the activity to my mother except to say it was electrical. I experienced levitation from the top of a bunk bed when I was 4 years old. I remember awakening 1 night finding my nose touching the ceiling. When I turned my head I was dropped back to the bed unharmed. Everyone of us (in a family of 7) witnessed hearing loud knocking noises in the attic many times. White zipping lights also would zoom down from the stairway and zip back up into the ceiling of the kitchen in the area above where my father would read his Bible and pray. Once my brother saw a pair of opened scissors were stuck into the ceiling…both prongs stuck in the ceiling over where my dad prayed. We did not think it was a coincidence. Once coming home from church my dad tried to get into the house. But something appeared to be holding our door shut. My brother Roger had to break into the back window to get in. We found that the floor to ceiling book cases, which held my dad’s Bible commentaries were thrown across the room and up against the front door. All the books were piled on the other side of the living room floor. Me and a few of my siblings witnessed a strange frost of what look like a layer of snowflakes on the walls even in the month of June!  We didn’t know what caused the strange cold. I witnessed a deformed creature at my window one evening. It looked like a male creature. It had bright green eyes encircle in red. It’s skin appeared to be melting or morphing as it turned it’s head side to side…as if it was coming through the glass of the window. My dad heard my scream and called the police out to our house for a brief investigation. Both my brothers witnessed (at different times) a totem pole creature. A 4 foot creature with heads all around it’s top part. Heads beneath, on its back and sides. It had long arms which reached the floor. It had a grimace on its face. After the bookcases had been ripped from the ceiling a pastor was called to cleanse the house and pray over us. However, the dark spirits were only stirred up even more. One day while my father was reading his Bible, my twin sister was preparing some dinner and I was outside the kitchen window. I heard the banging of something very loud. So loud that I saw the windows shake. The kitchen ceiling then came crashing down upon my father knocking him unconscious for a few minutes. He was bleeding and it took a moment for him to regain conscious. I knew something hated my father’s praying and communication with God. My father witnessed a 4 foot creature which glowed a greenish color. My father called it a leprechaun. It would try to rip the sheet from off his face at night. It wasn’t until he saw the creature for himself that he would admit it to my mother he was wrong for not believing his children’s claims. We had heard from elderly neighbors that a woman was killed at our home many years ago. We also heard from a person who lived 3 blocks down who claimed a female family member was killed in the back of the house. We could not corroborate any facts. My parents began to experience more paranormal with lights flickering off and on and pictures coming off the wall and sometimes come crashing down on their heads. My father’s health deteriorated and they moved out of the house to a peaceful apartment. A man and woman bought the house only to have their dogs go crashing through the same windows my dog was thrown through constantly. they were there only 1 year and then abandoned the house. The house sat abandon for many months when the serial arsonist began to hear voices (he claimed) come from the back of the house, and was later manipulated to burn it down. He went to prison for 6 years for felony charges of arson burning of my house and other structures. There is no house on the property today. The lot stands empty with all the trees still standing. I have been there with my paranormal equipment and have received high EMF and K2 hits near the back central part of the yard….where the original part of the house used to be…where the neighbors say a woman was murdered. No paper or archive can back that story up. But the house had a dark manipulative spirit which held many dark secrets."

After a period of inactivity at the house, investigators from the local police found the place abandoned and Dr. Webb’s family members violently murdered in every room. In the basement they found Dr. Webb’s torture chambers where he had perpetrated unspeakable experiments on his patients. The house was boarded up for 30 years after this, until the American Legion bought the property in the 1940s.

    "story": "Since the 1850’s, the Van Fossen cemetery has had many names, from Rodenbaugh Cemetery, the Old Adel Cemetery, to the “official” name recorded by the state, the Gibson Cemetery.\nAlong old highway 6, the cemetery is sometimes just called the Bilderback Cemetery, after the massive headstones that mark the graves of two of the town’s founders.\nThe cemetery is hidden, with no gravel path marking the access and even the sign hidden among over grown trees.\nBut away from the road and behind the brush, with an honest to goodness large pumpkin patch growing on the farm next to the cemetery; you’ll find the graves are well manicured and clean, even if most are long forgotten. A handful of the stones may show a solitary flag marking a veteran, or slowly decaying flowers left after a quick visit for a long dead ancestor. Thirty years ago when times were different, the graveyard had become a hangout for teenagers with typical teen irreverence, damaged some stones and committed acts that should never occur among graves. The local police began patrolling and trying to chase the teens off, but teens will be teens, and they would run to the woods and trickle back after the flashing lights had gone home to bed. As remembered by some of the residents of Adel, the carousing among the graves ended after May 11, 1983. A group of teens including an Iowa State astronomy freshman had gone to the park to watch comet IRAS make it’s closest approach to the Earth. After carousing in the dark for a few hours, they began to notice the night was unusually quiet. No crickets, no owls, no noise. Then under the stars and the glow of that strange, cloud-like comet, they noticed tiny sparks of blue light dancing on top of the two massive Bilderback graves. At first they thought it was a trick of the starlight, but the flecks became bigger and brighter until they looked like dim flashlights jumping around on top and between the stones. After that the teens simply took off. Whether the lights were ball-lighting on a clear night, will-o-wisps, or just a bad case of too much Thunderbird, the cemetery got a reputation that kept the teens away after that night. Regardless of local legend or what really happened as that comet reached the closest approach to the Earth, the old Van Fossen Cemetery has an ambiance rarely found in Iowa."

The club is also said to be haunted by a dance hall girl named Joanna who committed suicide. Ghost Adventures has featured the place on several of their TV shows, and in one episode one of the hosts is shown to be possessed. The caretaker Carl was also been taken over by a spirit."

A few days later, a woman was alone cleaning and saw that the feather bed looked as if someone had been lying in it, so she fluffed it up. When she returned shortly after, the imprint was in the bed again. She had not heard about the imprint made earlier. Other phenomena experienced here include the unexplained scent in the parlor of flowers which quickly turns to decayed meat; this happened on December 15, 2003.

Folks at the center have many stories about Joe, one of which involves country star Billy Ray Cyrus, who filmed his “Achy Breaky Heart” video there. Billy Ray was said to have chatted with Joe and gotten his advice during breaks. When he left, Billy Ray gave autographed posters to all the female staff, and also left one for Joe. All the posters were hung on the wall, as was the custom of the center. But as time went on and more and more autographed posters filled the wall, staff were asked to remove their Billy Ray ones, since there were so many, all alike. None of the staff wanted to remove theirs, so instead they removed Joe’s. The next day, so the stories go, all the other Billy Ray posters were strewn about the floor, many with their frames shattered as if someone wiped them all off the walls.

Many of the patients died. In the 1920s many of the caves were privately owned and in a battle to attract tourist dollars. Floyd Collins, who owned a section called Crystal Cave, was excavating when a boulder fell on his leg, pinning him. He was found the next day, but no one could move the heavy boulder, and people came from all over to follow the drama. After two weeks, Collins died, and his body was placed on display in the cave. The body was then stolen and found a few days later in a field, minus one leg, and he was put back in his cave coffin until the National Park System bought the cave and closed it to tourists. The cave, now determined to be part of the Mammoth Cave system, is rumored to be haunted. Floyd’s ghost is said to be heard calling for help, and objects have been thrown from an unknown source.

I’ve personally never seen a ghost there but I’ve had family members that reported on the history of the area. In the “Haintin’ Holler” a headless horseman has been reported, a trapper leading a horse with an Indian squaw,as well as odd lights from time to time, similar to the “Marfa lights” in Texas. And my personal interest was the “White Thangs” or “Polar Bears” story by my Grandfather’s brother David Turner. My Grandfather never saw anything odd but he did sleep in an abandoned house there once and something kept pulling his quilt off him in the middle of the night as he tried to sleep. My particular interest in this area was from the story of the “White Thangs” near the creek. I am a Bigfoot researcher and there are some reports of white colored Bigfoot sightings from the area. I’ve not seen one there but those are the reports of others that claim they have. It may be coincidence, but when I took my friend to the area, the temperature dropped about 10 degrees F when we enter the “Haintin’ Holler” and on our way out of it, the temp rose to the previous level. I’m not convinced this was “ghostly” related, but to a skeptic such as myself, it certainly was odd."

Young Corporal Marland then fought off 7 confederates and took his gun back, charging over the bridge back to Lafayette La. He was given a Medal of Honor for his actions there, and the bridge was named for him. The actual haunting of the bridge has nothing to do with that though. In the early 1900s, a woman was on her way to meet her fiance’ to get married at the nearby church. The congregation waited for hours until they went looking for her. Traveling back to her house, they had to cross Marland’s bridge and found her horse and buggy there. After searching around for her, they discovered her body in Bayou Bourbeau near the bridge. Years later, people passing over the bridge complain of their radios going on and off, and there are some eyewitness accounts of a girl in a white dress hovering over it.

The house wasn’t built until around 1830 – long after the Spanish left New Orleans (1801), and well before the Custom House was built (1848). Either way, the name “Morro Castle” has still stuck, and many locals still refer to it as such. If it is indeed haunted, there are no well-documented claims – just stories attached to tales that have long since been debunked. There are, however, reasonably-priced apartments in the building – so you’re welcome to move in for as little as $1,995/month and decide for yourself!"

    "story": "This is an odd one from “Ghost Stories of Old New Orleans,” a 1946 classic by Jeanne deLavigne.\nA crotchety old man named Abner White lived in this neighborhood, and he constantly terrorized the local children – in one case he even physically attacked a young girl named Ollie Voss, shaking her violently after a perceived affront.\nWhen Abner finally died, the entire neighborhood rejoiced, but it seemed he wasn’t quite finished with his nasty tricks.\nShortly after his death, Ollie Voss was burned to death in her home during a freak incident – a flaming brick shot out of her fireplace, apparently all on its own, and ignited her nightdress. As she was fighting the flames she screamed Abner White’s name, swearing she could see his face in the fireplace. As the story goes, Ollie’s little body was buried shortly thereafter – for some reason, right next to the tomb of Abner White. It seemed neither of them were happy with the arrangement. For about a week in 1890, somewhere over the 200 block of Cherokee Street where they once lived, it was said that the spirits of Ollie and Abner viciously fought each other night and day. No one could see them, but bricks and refuse were constantly being hurled from the sky onto unsuspecting bystanders along the block. This phenomenon continued day after day until finally Ollie’s remains were removed from the tomb and placed elsewhere, at which point the freakish rain of bricks finally ceased."

He said that a man dressed in a red and black checked lumberjack shirt and bib overalls had asked him why he was there. The man had medium-long hair which was parted in the middle and slicked down. He was clean shaven. He said he asked several of the others who this guy was, but nobody saw him. Nobody of that description belonged to the group. Several of the homeless said they had had experiences there, in particular 2 little girls who were there a lot just wandering. There was a grave with 2 little girl’s names.

    "story": "Seven years ago on my way home driving through Belmont, as I always did, around 2:30 in the morning I saw a woman in a long flowing white dress (looked like she was possibly in her late 30’s/early 40’s but I am bad with age) walking up Royal Road (right around 58 Royal Road) walking right up the street.\nAlthough I looked at her as I passed, she did not look at me and instead continued staring straight in front of her.\nI thought it was very odd for a woman to be out so late at night, all by herself, and her outfit choice was just bizarre.\nIt wasn’t a normal dress you’d see today. I can’t explain it. Just one minute later I did a U-turn in a driveway just around the corner by Thomas Street and came back to have a look at her again. She had just disappeared…….. It was not enough time for her in my turning around for fifteen seconds to have gone into any homes, let alone walked up a driveway she was passing by… She truly just disappeared. It was at this point I got the chills and realized this woman was not human. I still don’t know what she was, I wouldn’t say anything threatening or evil, but I am no expert. I just know for certain she was not human so I would say it was a ghost for sure. The reason why I now post this is because I have never forgotten this woman in the white dress walking that windy street in Belmont seven years ago, and want to know more as I am just as intrigued as I was that morning. I have heard other stories about people seeing this woman as well. I would love to learn more like the history of that road, maybe even the history of 58 Royal Road, etc. Please comment if you saw her also or have any insight as to this experience."

The museum is no longer part of the school system and had to shut it’s doors for about a decade due to lack of funding since the annexation from the schools. In 2003, however, a grassroots effort made it possible to reopen and welcome the public back inside, as the museum is now incorporated and not affiliated with any local schools. The most paranormal activity that is reported comes from the mezzanine, the planetarium and the southwest corner of the lowest level. Doors open and close on their own, conversations from people can be heard when no one is around, children laughing, items crashing down, items disappearing and reappearing, the elevator rides up and down with no one on it, etc. The most common reports are of people hearing their names whispered right into their ears and balls of flashing lights appearing out of nowhere in the planetarium."

    "story": "The Ghost Farm of Kingsley was old farm land just south of Traverse City MI.\nWe purchased the land several years ago.\nA mother and daughter currently own the land and have first hand experiences with what seems to be spirits that make their presence known.\nThe land is marked with an Native American Trail Tree and on the south side of the property lies a mound that looks like a burial mound. One harsh winter night, the daughter turned to look down her newly built barn to see a man with a fierce expression on his face. He seemed angry before disappearing on her. He was garbed in what looked like colonial-times clothes and has since then been dubbed The Colonial. The next day after a very heavy snowfall and ice storm, the new barn roof fell in but none of the farm animals were hurt. The daughter and mother duo have often come up to each other asking what the other wanted because they have heard their name called only to be left with puzzled expressions after being told that there names were not called by each other. One particular odd day of working on the farm had the daughter and mother giving up their work-as they had spent the whole day going back and forth to each other at opposite ends of the Farm after hearing their names called all day. Soon thereafter, the Ghost Farm of Kingsley was suitably named and we now to a fundraiser for local children’s organizations. It consists of a haunted walk and trick-or-treat spooky walk. For more information, on the hauntings or the Haunted Events go to our Facebook.com/GhostFarm page. One night while the daughter was setting up a fake gravestone at the Northern side of the farm, she thought she saw her sister walking up beside her. When she turned to ask what her sister thought of the construction on the haunted trail’s cemetery, a black shadow of a woman in a long dress floated by her, past the gravestones, and into the meadow with swirling fog. There are many stories to tell, but the weeping specter near a car during the haunted walk with cries coming from beside a vehicle still leaves goosebumps for those that work on the Ghost Farm of Kingsley. When inspected closer, no sign of a live individual could be found anywhere by the several witnesses. The weeping and shadow near the car eventually subsided and the shadow of a person crouched down dissipated along with the weeping."

We both saw out of the corner of our eyes “Dark shadowy figures” that appeared to be moving behind the trees and tombstones. As we arrived at the grave of our friend we sat there and had a cigarette. That is when we could hear what sounded like the laughter and snickering of children playing. That s when the uneasy feeling overtook us both and we both had the feeling that whatever is was that was there wanted us out. We began walking back to the gate at the main entrance. Both of us began to have the feeling that something was following us and it literally felt like pure evil. Our “walk” back to the entrance slowly turned into a run as we both were frightened. Then nearly at the same exact time, as we were almost back to the gate, we were both very violently shoved on the back causing us both to fall to the ground. We got up collected ourselves and both heard the rough voice of a man say very clearly “Get Out”. I have been back to the cemetery since but only during the daylight hours.

The castle was razed in 1988, but its ruins remain. One more eerie event told about in these parts is that of the “Iceman,” which began when a murdered body discovered here by a bicyclist in 1983. The autopsy showed ice crystals in blood vessels near his heart, leading investigators to think the body had been frozen so that his death would have been thought to have happened later than it actually did. In 1986 Richard Kuklinski confessed to being the killer and a mob hitman who killed over a hundred others, freezing their bodies the same way, earning him the nickname “Iceman.”"

Among its legends are ghostly victims of highwayman robberies, or the criminals themselves who were allegedly hanged from the road’s very trees. Bear Swamp (or Cat Hollow or Cat Swamp) is said to be infested with wild cats who attack travelers, and in 1850, malaria-carrying insects were said to teem here. At Ghost Lake, in the state forest south of the I-80 overpass, got its name from wraithlike formations that rise off of it in the mornings. The Fairy Hole, a cave to the right of Ghost lake, was once used by Lenape Indians but is now reportedly covered in graffiti. A cross street called Lenape Lane, a one-lane dead end just north of I-80, reportedly has an abandoned stable where apparitions and white orbs are seen. Look out–they say if the orb chases you and turns red, you will die.

    "story": "My grandparents owned a white adobe home with a terrace at the front of the home with stairs that went down into the backyard.\nIn the interior, there was  a fake fireplace in the living room.\nThe home had been for sale or rent when they moved to Deming but they passed on it after a showing however,  after looking for a few more weeks for a residence without any luck, they asked if it were still available.\nThey were advised it had been rented so they resumed their search. A couple of days later, the real estate company told them the single Mom and her kids had decided to go ahead and break their lease so the home was back on the market. That should have been the first warning. After moving into the home, my grandfather decided to refinish the fake fireplace to something more realistic looking. In the tearing out of the old facade, he found a black and white photo of himself and my grandmother in front of the home probably taken in the ’50s based on the lack of color and their personal attire. Fine and dandy except they hadn’t seen the home prior to 1978. Unfortunately, there wasn’t any info on the back of the photo. The home had one bathroom, two bedrooms and a large square shaped hallway connecting all three rooms. My grandmother put a cheap dinette chair in the smaller bedroom but would constantly find it placed in the square hallway. Downstairs, the screen door in the living room was always, always opening and closing, opening and closing. You had to latch it to keep it from happening. When they announced that they were moving, the kitchen door slammed shut so hard, the glass broke. When the neighbors found out my grandparents had put the home on the market, they asked if it was because of the ghost? Oh yeah, it seemed the home couldn’t keep an owner or renter because everyone would move out because of the ghost according to the neighbors. One afternoon, in preparation of the move, I was left alone to wash and box up the last of the dishes. As I was washing the dishes, I kept hearing footsteps and noises upstairs and thinking of the stairs off of the terrace, thought someone had come into the home. Despite numerous checks by myself, I didn’t find anyone but as soon as I’d get downstairs, the noises and knocking would resume. Very clearly, very distinctly, I knew that I was not alone. There was something else in the home with me. Quite a pronounced, creepy feeling. This is all well and good and honestly, if i heard it from someone else, I’d think they were just letting things they couldn’t explain spook them. Who doesn’t have some sort of spooky story to tell, especially at Halloween time. In fact, I think it’s Halloween storytelling that makes my story so different from others. About 8 yrs after my grandparents had sold the home and moved to another state, I was living in Tucson when my friends and I started telling ghost stories. I said I had a goodie so I wanted to go last and my friend Mike said he had a goodie, too so he wanted to go first. It seems his grandmother lived a street over from a haunted house in New Mexico. I jokingly asked if it was Deming and he turned white and said yes, how did I know? I’m sure I turned white and asked him if there was anything odd about home’s look, like a fountain in the front yard. He said no, no fountain but it did have a balcony with stairs that lead into the backyard and a fireplace… So, a few more years pass and I’m now married, still living in another state and hundreds of miles away from Deming. I’d told my hubby my ghost story before – he humored me and said it was good but he didn’t believe it. But one night, again around Halloween, he comes home from work all out of sorts so I asked him what’s wrong and he said a few of my buddies at lunch were telling ghost stories when one guy said let me tell you about this haunted house I stayed at in New Mexico. I was in the shower when someone started banging on the bathroom door. I was all by myself n the house but then I remembered that it had a terrace with stairs that led down into the backyard…"

As most of the buildings have been boarded up, I wasn’t able to go inside any of the buildings (and, to be honest, I wasn’t necessarily looking for a way in). The howling winds of Rochester, NY, and the cold, eerie weather set the mood and I was definitely feeling a little spooked, even as I walked around its exterior, assuming that every sound I heard was coming from someone or something inside of its walls. Going through my pictures afterwards, I took the picture attached. It was inside of the Walters Building.

They came across the ‘secret room’, and as you can see in the picture, it looked pretty scary and someone had to go down first.”      I am not entirely sure how we went from passers-by on the street and the front porch to some secret room (was the secret room located on the front porch??

The Castle, the college’s trademark, has many lost souls that still roam the halls. Originally, the castle was home to Mr. Whitelaw Reid, a millionaire. His three children died in the castle during a terrible fire, and still roam the hallways of the west room right where the painting of them is. Other strange occurrences include the temporary immobilization of tour guides while giving tours to students, cold spots and sensations of being watched while roaming the halls. There are several accounts of doors opening and closing by themselves. Just behind the Castle, you can find the graveyard, final resting place of the founders of Manhattanville College and the nuns that once worked there. During the night, you can go see the three statues, if flash pictures are taken, they may come out blurry or have orbs surrounding the statues. A quick walk down the path from the cemetery is the Old Chapel, complete with an underground catacomb system that acted as the final resting place to the nuns who passed away while working at the college. It wasn’t until the chapel was abandoned that the bodies were moved to the cemetery. Dark shadows can be seen when exploring while footsteps in the gravel outside can be heard in the early morning. Unfortunately, the residence halls have no shortage of paranormal activity either. Residents have experienced odd scratches down their feet as well as locked doors swinging open in the middle of the night. Spellman Hall, the freshman dormitory building, is most famous for the Ghost of 118. It is said that back when the school was of a Catholic persuasion and the faculty of nuns lived on campus, one nun hung herself in her room, Spellman 118. Since then, the room has been renovated and combined with a surrounding room to accommodate to the Resident Advisor. The door was covered in bricks and the number 118 was removed, but was the ghost? Her spirit has been felt roaming the halls, opening doors probably to check on the children that used to be in her care. Manhattanville College is absolutely haunted throughout its campus.

This photo does not do it justice as you would need to see the video to have a better understanding of this entity. 2) “The Spirit in the Elevator” During overnight hours, the two elevators inside city hall are locked to the lower first floor and are not suppose to function between floors until unlocked by a city maintenance technician. However accounts of the elevators going between floors and randomly opening and closing as if someone was riding on them occurres almost on a nightly basis. No actual spirit or entity has been seen however on or around the elevators. 3) “The Tall Top Hat Man” One of the more frightening and most prevalent entities in city hall is a figure of a tall dark shadowy man wearing a top hat. He is known and has been seen wandering the halls at night of city hall mostly on the second and third floors. He has however on occasion been spotted on the first floor as well. He usually will appear and watch people inside the building at night, sometimes following them and when you approach him however or try to make contact, he tends to walk into a room that will only have one entrance. When you enter the room to find him there is no one there. Reports of this man have been made to officers as well which have spotted him inside the building as a “trespasser” after hours, on the account of the one time contact was made officers followed the spirit into an enclosed concreted mail room where again he vanished with no physical way of escape."

    "story": "Back in 1828, when this historic hotel was constructed, it was merely a trading post and tavern with limited overnight accommodation.\nAt various times throughout the century, the building also served as a prison and a town ballroom.\nThe strange history of the building began back in the 1840’s, after a farmer staying at the hotel vanished from his room during the night without a trace.\nYears later, a local man confessed to the murder, but never gave any reason for why it had occurred. The farm worker was never able to move on apparently, as staff and guests claim to have seen him wandering the halls after hours, and have heard moans and screams from the room he stayed in. In the 1880’s, a young lady was locked in a room at the inn for many years after she accidentally murdered her stepbrother, and was allegedly driven mad. Strange noises have been heard coming from the room in which she perished, and the furniture often rearranges of its own accord. Somewhere in the inn, there is a prison cell which was used by authorities when the hotel was a stopover point for travellers, and it became common practice to lock drunk and disorderly patrons in this room overnight. However, one morning, a member of staff found a patron dead in the prison cell, and only days later, began to hear strange noises. Nowadays, the door to the cell will not shut, and if it is, pounding fists and yells for help can be heard. Recently, guests and staff reported a ghostly floating head in the ballroom fireplace, which is believed to stem from a murdered townsperson who was stabbed then locked in a closet in that particular room. Staff and visitors claim to hear ballroom music, ghostly voices and cutlery moving, but upon investigation find nothing. The apparition of a young girl has also been seen in the bar area, and is known as a mischievous spirit, who moves around objects and is responsible for the ghostly laughter heard by many."

    "story": "We have had numerous sitings at the Taverne.\nThe building was built in 1886 in Richfield Ohio as a hotel/stagecoach stop.\nWe have 3 ghosts.\nThe original ghost is Baxter Wood who opened a hotel called the Center Hotel in the building which now houses local watering hole, the Doug Out. He later built and  opened a new hotel across the street, the West Richfield Inn which is now called the Taverne of Richfield. He is described as a tall man in a suit and top hat with an “Abraham Lincoln” beard. He hangs out in the Ballroom, presumably since it’s the most originally structured room, not much has been altered in that room since the building of the Taverne. Our other 2 ghosts are Mrs. Rebecca Akers and her son, Elijah. Rebecca mostly resides in the stairwells often holding people’s hands as they walk up and down the stairs. Although we caught a picture of her dancing in the ballroom. Her son Elijah is a feisty poltergeist who runs through the ballroom and says “Hi There.” These two came only recently along with the stained glass windows that were purchased in 1996 from a burnt down church in Dayton Ohio. Rebecca died an older woman but her ghost is her as a young lady. It’s rumored that Elijah died as a child so Rebecca’s ghost reverted to when he died and they stayed together in the church posthumously. The stained glass windows memorialize Rebecca’s name. Activity of ghostly happenings include doors opening and closing by themselves, glasses flying off the bar and tables, orbs appearing in pictures, chilly drafts, chairs scooting away from the bar by themselves, tables being unset. Recently, a patron and former employee from the 70’s informed us that when he worked there they had a big wedding to set up for in the ballroom, They stayed late the night before and got all the tables, chairs, silverware, glassware, napkins and everything all set up. The next morning when the florist arrived they instructed her to go up and start setting up everything is ready for her. Much to everyone’s shock (and dismay) the whole room was empty. Every table and chair stacked in a corner, every piece of silverware back in the drawer, every linen neatly folded and put back in the linen closet. But that’s just the stories, check it out for yourself!"

    "longitude": -82.65036980000002,
    "story": "Along the banks of the Ohio River in Ironton, Ohio is Woodland Cemetery, also known as the City of the Dead.\nFounded in 1871, it presently contains more than 8,000 graves.\nThe cemetery entrance is beautifully gated and the cemetery itself is beautifully landscaped.\nIts departed residents include veterans from the American Civil War, celebrated local persons, and its share of ghost stories and local legends. If you happen to be in the cemetery after dark, you might catch a glimpse of ballerina Antoinette Peters, also known as Teenie. It has been reported that on nights when the moon is full her ghost can be seen dancing outside her mausoleum where her body is entombed. Antoinette Peters was a dancer with the Imperial Russian Ballet and the Chicago Opera. She met and married a local industrialist and settled in Ironton, Ohio. Sadly, she was unfortunately killed in a car crash in Illinois. Not long after her funeral, her mausoleum was broken into by vandals. Aside from breaking part of the top of her glass coffin, they stole a brooch she received from a Russian Czar which was a valued possession of her. They also heartlessly off two of her fingers to steal her rings. A ceramic photograph attached to the outside of her mausoleum depicts her youth and beauty, but sadly, another vandal has shot at it with a BB gun, breaking part of the photograph off. Despite the unkind acts by callous vandals, “Teenie” continues to dance happily in the moonlight for anyone who is fortunate enough to notice. One of the more elaborate and beautiful statues in the cemetery is of a woman descending the stairs. The expressionless woman’s statue belongs to Osa Wilson, also known as the Slapped Lady. Osa was born in 1877 and died a terrible death in 1911 at the age of 34. The commonly told story is that her husband was very abusive towards her, both verbally and physically. One evening he arrived home drunk, but had brought her flowers. An quarrel arose and in an anger, Osa’s husband slapped her across the face causing her to fall down a flight of stairs. The fall fatally injured her and the unborn child she was carrying. Standing in front of the statue, one will notice the right cheek is different than her left cheek. Looking more closely, a red mark is noticeable, resembling a hand print. Several efforts have been made to sandblast it and repair it, but all have been unsuccessful. The red mark always returns. The hands of the figure have been broken off but it is said that at one time, they were holding flowers. Adding to the tale is the real tears that the statue is said to cry, the belly that is warm to the touch even in the middle of winter, and the faint baby’s heartbeat that can be felt. According to newspaper articles, there is truth to the story. Osa and her husband did have a turbulent marital relationship and he was very abusive towards her. He did strike her once with such force that she fell down the stairs and she was pregnant at the time. After her death, he was able to get out of being convicted of killing her and commissioned the statue to be made as a tribute of his ‘undying love’. Many people visit her grave, not only to see the stunning statue, but to also pay respects and leave flowers. Although not written in words on her tomb, her sad, tragic story of her life can be seen in the cold blank stare of her statue. One of the more gruesome tales belongs to a illustrious physician, Dr Joseph Lowry. He is alleged to haunt the cemetery and the location of the Briggs Lawrence County Public Library where his house once stood. He can also been seen in Woodland Cemetery often waling alongside his mother, whom is also buried in the cemetery. She was killed in a carriage accident, her neck being broken when she was thrown from the carriage. Dr. Lowry and his mother are seen walking from their grave sites toward the entrance gates, but they always disappear before they reach the bridge at Route 52. Dr. Lowry died in 1933 under some puzzling circumstances. He was found dead in his bed with the heat on high in the middle of summer. Doctors officially determined his death to be caused by a stroke, but officials and townspeople suspected that his heirs murdered him or had him murdered. The undertaker who was taking care of Dr. Lowry’s remains was still upset with him and decided to take some revenge on the deceased doctor. Two years before his death, the doctor had asked the undertaker to make a special custom coffin for his wife, yet he had never paid for the coffin. In revenge for nonpayment, the undertaker broke both of the doctor’s legs, folded them underneath him in order to fit him into the small coffin he had made for the doctor’s wife, and stuffed him into the coffin he had wanted for his wife. With the doctor stuffed in the coffin, the lid wouldn’t close over the doctor’s stomach, so the undertaker extracted some more revenge. He cut the doctor open, took out his inner organs, sewed him back up, and buried the organs in another location. The authorities decided that they wanted to have his organs tested to see if he had been murdered by poisoning. When they told the undertaker that they needed to organs, he admitted to police what he had done. Upon unburying the organs, deterioration had began, making it impossible to check them for poison residue. From noted physician to possible murder victim, the doctor now roams near his old residence looking for his body parts and strolls around the cemetery. Aside from the stories of hauntings at Woodland Cemetery, there are beautiful statues, gravestones, landscaped gardens, and historical graves. Continuing to be a popular burial site, Ironton’s “City of the Dead” will continue to grow with a sleeping population for many years to come!"

The mob stormed the entrance and rammed it down to get to Etheridge, who was beaten to death with a hammer before they dragged him out and hanged him from a telegraph pole. Witnesses say the jail is haunted by apparitions, electronic voice phenomena, and more, much of which has been recorded. At least 15 deaths have occurred here in the prison’s 100-year history."

It was discovered that she had spent a night at the house of William Moore and had been seen leaving in a buggy with his sister-in-law, Fannie Norton, who later returned alone. Detectives found the baby unharmed, having been given to a boy by Fannie Norton; the baby’s clothing was bloody. Katie’s body was discovered, head severed, near Deer Creek. The details of the murder are unclear to this day. The sister-in-law denied murdering Katie, but committed suicide by poisoning the day she was questioned. In these parts, a blue formless light has been reported, as well as the sound of a ghostly woman crying for baby."

The basement was frequented by music students after dark, because it was mostly made up of practice rooms, to which they were allowed access 24/7. Students who attempted late night cram sessions, however, heard a little more music than what was actually on the curriculum. Many students have reported hearing a piano being played on one of the upper floors between 12:30 and 2am. It’s most commonly heard in the stairwell in the center of the building between the basement and ground floor. Every report agrees that it comes from one of the upper floors, however no one has made it more than a few steps above the ground floor before the music stops. Some have reported it starting once more upon descending the stairs again, many have exited the building, circled it’s parameter, and found no lights to be on, and some dismiss the entire experience as having imagined it…until they hear accounts from other students."

He appears as a tall, slender man (6′ or more and skinny)  He moves quickly as a dark grey or black image gliding past the employees, usually after he tickles them. For some reason, he locks the front door after people leave and selects music on the jukebox, without any money going in to start the songs. Also, the songs he picks are not songs that are installed in the machine.  (I believe he is a Country and Western fan) Normally, I would call BS on this sort of thing, but what is happening appears to be real or at the very least unexplained."

Then the oldest daughter Mary Olive died six months later. After son Edwin became ill and left for Colorado Springs, another daughter, Mercy Lena, died in 1892 at age 19. Since it was winter and the ground was frozen, Mercy Lena’s body was set inside a crypt near the rest of her family at Chestnut Hill Cemetery. Locals became concerned about all the deaths, and thought perhaps one of the dead was coming back to claim the living family members. Worried that this may be true, George arranged for the bodies to be exhumed. Most were in decay, but Mercy’s was found shifted and fresh. So her heart was cut out, and it dripped with fresh blood. It was burned atop a stone wall in the cemetery. Some of the ashes were given in a potion to sickly Edwin, who had returned, but he died two months later. Reports say that when “Dracula” author Bram Stoker passed away in 1897, newspaper stories about Mercy Brown were found in his possessions. Author H.P. Lovecraft, who lived in Providence, also mentioned Mercy in his short story “The Shunned House.”"

A bar tender would sometimes see the man peak around the corner at the back of the bar. The man looks like he is trying to get the bar tenders attention without being seen by others in the bar. As the bar tender would walk towards him, he would duck behind the corner and disappear. This same man has been seen dancing with a female in one of the ballrooms.

An overnight security guard has received numerous calls of an oddly dressed man crying uncontrollably in the rear function room with the lights off. When the situation is investigated, you can clearly see the man sitting in a chair crying into his hands. The prostitute: In the Annex units, which were part of a brothel before the original structure was destroyed by a terrible hurricane, complaints of the closet door rattling like someone is pounding from the inside trying to get out happens fairly often. There is no cause for this happening, but maintenance typically tells guests that its the vibration from the air conditioning system from outside. Maintenance Shop Prankster: Tools are constantly going missing in the maintenance office. Sometimes tools will be gone for days, or just long enough to annoy you. The tools always returned to the exact location that it went missing. Kitchen Poltergeist: This is a nasty little ghost that the staff refers to as “Jester.” Jester seems to be a menace. Plates of food have flown off the cooking stations, pots and pans slamming together in the middle of the night while simultaneously turning on all of the faucets. During the overnight shifts, he can be heard banging on the duct work while deeply laughing into the vents. There has been one occurrence where jester was taunted by a friend of someone covering the desk. As she leaned back into the desk chair claiming that this place wasn’t so scary, she was pushed forward and received three scratches on her back. The two of them were then drawn into the lobby where they kept hearing people talking at the front desk. They could hear whistling coming up the rear hallway by the kitchen, the tune was getting closer to the lobby, but when  the “whistler” should have reached the lobby, the tune would continue in the bar and through the back ball rooms…as if the spirit  were circling them. This place has been underestimated over the years and should be a nice hot bed for a ghost hunter to investigate. These are true stories from former staff members."

Years went by and the parents passed away, and the daughter became an old spinster who lived with her pack of pet dogs. One night when the dogs were baying incessantly, the neighbors came over to find her dead body, surrounded by her beloved pets. Her ghost is still seen around the premises, surrounded by her ghost dogs, and her signal lantern still lights in the window. Some speculate that this story is a concoction by rumrunners, who actually used the light as a signal."

In August 2014 in a conversation to a Haunted Places representative, a hotel employee debunked the claims about room 707. They said the rumors mostly started because the lights in that room have a tendency to flicker – and they do so because the room is in the top most part of the former train station aligned with the tracks and are subject to vibrations as the train passes. In addition, the narrow and claustrophobic atmosphere of the 7th floor, which is in the former attic, lends itself to an oppressive, looming feeling that makes one susceptible to tales of hauntings. However, this employee did say that the ghost that walks the balcony on the third floor (which is also actually the lobby floor) has been spotted several times, and it is this ghost that appears to leap to its death over the railing to the parking lot below. Although we did have a room on the 3rd floor with an unobstructed view of the balcony, we witnessed nothing of any interest either of the two nights we stayed there."

    "story": "At the end of Walkup Road in Pegram, Cheatham County, Tennessee is the bulldozed Pegram Family Cemetery.\nAbout 1970, ruthless developers bulldozed an area along the Harpeth River which included the Pegram Cemetery which was partly in Metro Nashville, Davidson County and partly in Pegram, Cheatham County.\nThe developers also sold dirt and other materials from the site and the river as fill dirt.\nMany small houses were built on concrete slabs- In 1975, The River rose 30 plus feet and one of the last coffins popped to the surface in the yard of resident Archie Greer and the local TV was on the spot with “shades of poltergeist!”   The coffin contained the remains of Mrs. Carrie Pegram Heath who was the Town’s first postmistress. Her picture can be seen in the Pegram P.O. at present. Metro Nashville would have nothing to do with the mess and had the County line moved so that it was not their problem….. Cheatham County and Pegram continued to allow building and put big up-front impact fees on new building which allowed them to build a new Town Hall which has been plagued with problems including legal fees for their own mistakes amounting to over $500,000. In addition, the people who lived in the “politically abandoned” subdivision called Harpeth Haven were again flooded in 2010….. Poor Mrs. Carrie was “pushed back down” into the ground….. Just last week, the Fire department was out and the local supermarket burned…. several fires that the Fire Department  extinguished have “restarted” several times. The Town built a sewer which is much troubled and not much in the Town seems to work …. people just cannot be that incompetent without some outside help…. and scattered all over the area is the soil from the Pegram Cemetery site…. Yep, its haunted!"

Two specific ones stand out, those being a young woman in her 30’s, and a young girl between 8 and 12 years of age. These spirits are some of the more active ones, with the woman making a showing regularly on the over night shift. The little girl is more mischievous, prone to moving objects around, or turning machines on or off. Other spirits sighted are men in coveralls, as well as a tall man in a suit which looks to date from the 20’s or 30’s. The exact cause of the spirits is unknown, though the company history (and employees) note that until sometime in the mid 1980’s, the plant had two ovens (used for ceramics) on the property which had previously been used as crematoriums. It’s believed they may have been original to the funeral home, though once again no data supports this. Access to the location is SEVERELY limited, due in part to the company’s position as a Department of Defense contractor. Furthermore, getting someone to even speak about their sightings proves difficult, with employees either afraid to admit what they have sighted, or fearing punishment from the company for divulging too much."

    "story": "Formerly the Eddy House, the building that houses the High Life Ski Club Lodge has a long history of being haunted–since at least 1874.\nOriginally the home of Zepaniah Eddy, who had three children: William, Horatio and Mary, descended from a long line of psychics.\nThe Eddys were mediums from a young age, as evidenced by disembodied voices, pounding, house-shaking, and even vanishing in their cribs as infants.\nThey also were said to play with ghostly children who vanished when others would draw near. They often went into trances or spoke in spirits’ voices. Banished from school because of levitating desks and books that flew through the air, the children were often beaten by their furious father Zepaniah. Sick of it all, the man sold his children to a traveling sideshow that took them all over the U.S., Canada and Europe for 14 years. In the shows, they suffered even worse abuse than they had received from their father. When Zepaniah died, the boys moved back to the farm with their sister Mary, and they opened the house as the Green Tavern, an inn. The inn had a history of being extremely haunted, and when attorney Henry Steel Olcott read about it in a newspaper story, he went to investigate. He arrived to find a seance being conducted by Horatio Eddy, where at least 10 spirits appeared. Olcott examined the seance room and spirit cabinet for false panels or other deception, and found none. Seances were held nightly; spirits who appeared included Chinese, Russians and Africans, and even inanimate objects, and they often gave performances. As the spirits often spoke in other languages and the Eddys were known to be illiterate, fraud was unlikely. Olcott, convinced of the authenticity of the Eddys’ abilities, wrote a book called People from Other Worlds, which included a description of his exploration of the Eddys, including drawings of the spirits, the grounds, and the Eddy house."

Alcoholism lost him his job, and he became a wanderer, eventually landing in a New Orleans prison.

But in 1974, the portrait was taken off the wall again to be shipped to a New York City comference about items associated with paranormal phenomena. While in its exhibit, the portrait began to rock crazily in front of many spectators. Further, when the painting was locked up at night, it somehow escaped, and was found the next morning outside its storage container and pointing toward the exit. When the portrait was shipped home again and placed back onto the wall, the eerie occurrences stopped."

Nothing dangerously negative has been reported, though teenage males occasionally report feeling extremely uncomfortable in one upstairs room. Some ghosts there appreciate the effort made by investigators to encounter them, and will attempt to interact with investigators by knocking back to knocks made on walls and by giving direct answers to direct questions during EVP sessions. In this way, the names of several ghosts have been recorded:  Tuck was a servant; Barbara was a cook; Grace may have been mistress of the house at one point; there is also a spirit named Susan; several female ghosts have mentioned a man named Rev. Edward Crawford whose connection to the families that lived in the house is unclear, but turned out to be an actual historic character from 18th century Virginia. The proprietor and staff are friendly and approachable, but prohibit any ghost hunting activity during business hours as it “spooks” the antique store’s regular customers. They do offer a ghost hunting tour during the last weekend of each month, during which guests are encouraged to bring their own ghost hunting equipment.

She was said to have even become engaged to a woman, although she never married–in fact, the girl’s father followed Mary home and made the family shell out money for the deception. Mary died in the house, and still lingers, many say. According to reports, Mary has knocked over vases and furniture, and created the sound of breaking glass although nothing was found to be broken. She has turned up the volume of a stereo and a jukebox, and turned on water and appliances. Some feel that Mary is bored or lonely and just would like to have a little attention."

So the morgue is under the hospital. The hospital is in a residential area and people call the police if you try and get in. It is boarded up now and has locks on the doors.

    "longitude": -122.58869773140759,
    "story": "It was approximately 4:28 pm some time in March of 2015.\nI drove my 4×4 north on Baby Doll Rd. hoping to get “out of town” for an hour so to clear my head.\nI brought my camera and had planned on using my 4 wheel drive on the trail into the woods and taking some pictures of the sunset.\nAt the end of the road (where Baby Doll turns into dirt), I parked my car for and sat there fiddling with my camera, for less than five minutes. i knew i had to hurry before it became too dark to take any photos. I put my truck into four wheel drive and looked up into the rearview mirror to back up and there in the mirror, plain as day, was a young girl with dark brown hair and even darker  marble-like eyes, staring expressionlessly back at me from the back seat. I stared at her without blinking for several seconds, afraid to actually turn my head around to look behind me. I turned of the motor, yanked the keys out of the ignition and jumped out of the truck. All I could say was, “OMG, OMG.! Are you serious?” Proceeded by what was me responding to myself with, “No way, no way, nope!” I looked all around me and the truck and neither saw nor heard anything or anyone. I slowly slipped back into the driver’s seat, nervously lit up a cigarette and mustered up the courage (upon rationalizing that I hadn’t just seen what I had) to look directly behind me. I spun my head around fast enough to cause whiplash, eyes bugging out of my head and saw nothing. Then, almost slightly disappointed, I looked back up into the rearview and again, and again and then a final glance into my mirror…nothing. I swayed back and forth in my seat to see if there was a glare from the setting sun or a smudge on the mirror or ANYTHING on or near the backseat which could even cast a shadow resembling a person or child. NOTHING! It was still light enough outside to take some pictures, which I did. I got back into the vehicle, hesitated for a moment to pray and cast out any possible unwanted demons that may have intended on hitching a ride home with me then, looked up into the rear view, saw nothing, and headed home still shaken by the experience. This is not the first time I have had an encounter with the “unknown”, I had a brief experience, also in Port Orchard, not far from Baby Doll Rd., where the voice of an elderly woman clearly asked me “What was I doing?”  while I stood, alone, in a tiny shed in a backyard of an old farmhouse that was for sale. I was reading aloud from a dusty stack of faded Greeting cards written to “Grandma”. I set the cards down and apologized for going through her things and promptly excused my self, never turning around, because there was no way anyone else could have come into the small space. I had been almost 40 years though, when it began. I was a child whern I witnessed three separate “hauntings” all within the same neighborhood. Fortunately, the first was with my mother  (the sobbing woman hovering a foot above the ground, with her arms stretched outward beckoning my mother, wearing a flowing black dress. Her head and face covered by a black lace shawl as if dressed for a funeral). The 2nd, I was with my Grandma (an elderly woman in her nightdress and night cap carrying a brass candle holder with a lit candle, as she hovered up the staircase in an old Colonial home and earlier that day in the same house, as I looked peeked into the abandoned home through a window pane of the French door off the kitchen. On the counter, I saw a Dixie cup rise three feet up into the air, levitate and then fall to the floor. It was later that day I had begged my Grandmother to accompany me back to the home. This happened on Long Island, NY. To have these experiences…is it a curse or a gift, I am not sure, though, I am much less leery of sharing these stories with others nowadays where the Paranormal World is much more accepted by the worlds many skeptics, which, I would surely be, if this stuff hadn’t happened to me. I do, some day plan on returning to Baby Doll Rd. to look for that young girl with the straight dark brown hair and eerie blank stare. Perhaps, she had some message for me. Perhaps, she just wanted to go for a drive. I just don’t know…"

    "story": "It’s been a while since this encounter(2005?), but as it was my first, I feel like I should share in hopes that someone out there may be able to validate this experience aside from me and my husband.\nMy husband and I were traveling home from a family visit on the Olympic Peninsula via the coastal route  when we landed in Long Beach Washington towards evening.\nWe decided to stay at The Thunderbird Motel as it was somewhat close to the Elks Lodge.\nWe were tired and cheep lodging for the evening would do. Upon checking in, I noticed a couple of units which seamed desirable towards the back of the totally empty motel (possibly closer to the beach for better ambiance) and asked the Korean owner if either was available. She said that both of those units had three beds, but if we only used one bed, she would charge us the lower rate. Okay…we were tired after family and driving and just need a room. We check into a unit which has a small kitchenette, super tiny bathroom, a small cold back bedroom and a main room with a queen sized bed, sofa sleeper and small desk and chairs. We decided to close the second room and just heat the main room/bedroom/kitchen area to keep things cozy. I turned on the left side bedstand reading light and as I went to remove my hand it went off. Thinking it was a loose bulb, I moved my hand near and before I could could get my hand near to tighten the bulb, it went back on. As I moved my hand away, it went off. I thought it might be the plug and as soon as I moved my hand near, the light turned back on. I tightened things down and as soon as I moved a few inches away, the light turned off. Frustrated, I moved close to check the fixture once again and as soon as I got close, the light turned on, move away, the light turned off. I alerted my husband to the occurrence and he watched as for the next few seconds I could move my hand towards the fixture and it would turn on, move it away and it would turn off. I laughed and said, “Well, I give up.”  As I walked away, the light remained on. We were tired and hungry and it was time for dinner. Good thing we had a kitchenette!  A little dinner music was in order, and while traveling, I always bring my wind up radio. Wound it up and tuned in to a great coast radio station. The perks of being somewhat close to Seattle and Olympia! The soup was heating and we were enjoying sips of flask whiskey to surprisingly great music. We got up and were dancing to the music on the radio when the chill came on. The wind-up radio became filled with static, the lights flickered and went out and it became so suddenly cold in the room, we could see out breathe. I looked at my husband and said, “I think we may be staying in a haunted room” and suddenly all was back to normal. Weird. We ate soup and wondered if we should consider moving locations for a good night sleep. Tired, we decided to stay. Nothing harmful, just weird…was it all in our heads? Early every morning, around 3am, my bladder wakes me up. I was laying in bed contemplating the trip to the toilet when I heard the doorknob on the closed bedroom rattle. I immediately thought a break in might be happening and woke up my hubby. Just as I was waking him up, we both heard the bedroom door open then slam shut with great force. We jumped out of bed. My husband was ready for combat, I was ready to run. All was quiet. We investigated the closed bedroom and all was calm, musty and very unsettling. After winding down, we lay in bed till dawn. Not sure if we could stay in the Thunderbird again without feeling a bit apprehensive. Online, this place seems to have a seedy reputation (didn’t know it then). Would love to hear if anyone else can justify this type of experience at this location. I can’t quite remember the room number, maybe 13 or 14, but it is the left unit at the back of the lot."

This prison housed Wyoming’s death row, and nine men were hanged and five died in the gas chamber there. In addition to state-sanctioned executions, several men died there in riots, escape attempts, suicides and murders, including one prisoner who was lynched by other inmates who were outraged that he had indecently and grossly assaulted an elderly, local townswoman. Approximately 250 people died here including both inmates and prison guards. The prison is a hotbed of paranormal activity with ghost hunters claiming there are both residual and active hauntings occurring there. The negative energy from the prison’s brutal 80 year history has coalesced into several different phenomena. People hear voices, there are cold spots and several people have reported seeing full-body apparitions of former inmates.

    "longitude": -108.76329007740424,
    "story": "This church is the oldest standing building in Powell.\nIn 1948 the building was moved from the corner of 3rd and Bent Streets to the corner of Park and Douglas street.\nNothing specific is really known about the history of the building (besides the fact that it used to the Presbyterian Church- which is located at the original site in a new building).\nI grew up in this church, and so sometimes people ask me odd questions that are obviously trying to get information regarding any paranormal experiences that may have occurred in the building. I have also spoken to several people who I know well enough to be open about discussing the experiences. Most people report that they find the building peaceful unless they are there alone. Even with doors locked the doors can be heard opening and closing, but when a person goes to see who came in the door is still locked and the person is alone (this is a small church- you wouldn’t miss someone). Footsteps and voices can be heard on\n the opposite level of where you are in the building, but when you go to the level where the noise is occurring, the noise seems to migrate to the level you were just on. The most common complaint is a horrifying sensation of “someone standing behind you.”  This sensation becomes overwhelming to the point that people have been to known to leave the building in haste. For example it is not uncommon to enter the building to find the vacuum plugged in in the middle of a row of pews and no sign of the cleaner. The common visual disturbance is an catching a glimpse of something (the shape is difficult to make out) that is about the size of a cat, but it is just a shadow-type figure. It is either seen running past a doorway or caught “out of  the corner of the eye.”  Today the church has erected a parsonage for the pastor to live in, but in the past the basement of the church was an apartment for the pastor. On at least two occasions, Pastors living in the church itself fled i\n n the middle of the night, and gave no notice, but left resignation letters. The person I spoke to stated that there were no known problems with the pastors in terms of mental/emotional concerns or conflicts with the congregation- they just left for no known reason. When one walks by the church today, nothing is visible, but many report sensing a presence “watching them” from one of the windows- although the window is not always the same (the upper level is really one giant room)- most can identify the exact window that the presence is “watching” from."
